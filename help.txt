Quick guide to VideoSubtitles_bot.
This bot is designed to search and create subtitles for video from YouTube.
You can give him a link to the video and if the subtitles are found you will see the message "*** Good URL. There is subtitles for this video: ***". Uploading subtitles may take several seconds.
If there are no subtitles, you will see the message "*** Good URL. Wait for the audio file loading ***". This means that the bot need some time to load the audio track from the video and handle it. He will report the end of the process with a message "*** Audio file is loaded. Now messages with subtitles will come to you ***".
Then the bot with periodicity in a few seconds will send you fragments of subtitles. If the server could not recognize the audio fragment, you will see "*** Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition could not understand this fragment ***". If server could not send request you will see "*** Could not request results from Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition service ***"
At the end of the subtitles "*** Subtitles are over ***" will be displayed. Having created subtitles for this video once you no longer have to wait yet - the subtitles for each handled video are saved.
If there is no correct YouTube video URL you get message "*** This is no valid URL. Please enter correct YouTube video URL ***"
